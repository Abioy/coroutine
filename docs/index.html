<h2>Overview</h2>

libCoroutine is a simple stackfull coroutine implementation. On unix platforms, the implementation uses ucontext if available or with setjmp/longjmp otherwise except on OSX where some assembly is used. On windows, fibers are used. <br>
<p>

<h2>Main</h2>

First you'll need to create a coro instance to represent the C stack that was allocated to run the host program's main() function:

<pre>
Coro *mainCoro = Coro_new();
Coro_initializeMainCoro(mainCoro);
</pre>

<h2>Starting</h2>

To create a coroutine:
<pre>
Coro *newCoro = Coro_new();
Coro_startCoro_(currentCoro, newCoro, aContext, aCallback);
</pre>

currentCoro should be a pointer to the currenting running coroutine (which would be mainCoro, if this is the first corountine you're creating). aCallback is a function pointer for the function which will be called when the coroutine starts and aContext is the argument that will be passed to the callback function.

<h2>Switching</h2>

To switch to the coroutine:

<pre>
Coro_switchTo_(currentCoro, nextCoro);
</pre>

<h2>Freeing</h2>

<pre>
Coro_free(aCoro);
</pre>

Note that you can't free the currently running coroutine as this would free the current C stack.

<h2>Stacks</h2>

You can check to see whether a corouinte has nearly exhasted it's stack space by calling:

<pre>
Coro_stackSpaceAlmostGone(aCoro);
</pre>

This returns 1 if the remaining stack space is less than CORO_STACK_SIZE_MIN. 
<p>
The define CORO_STACK_SIZE can be used to adjust the default stack size. There is also a #ifdef on USE_VALGRIND which, when enabled, will register stack switches with valgrind, so it won't be confused.

<h2>Chaining</h2>

A trick to provide effectively get unlimited stack space while keeping stack allocations small is to periodically call Coro_stackSpaceAlmostGone() and create a new Coro in which to continue the computation when the stack gets low.
